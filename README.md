# Wordle

A game that I made in Fusion using vscode with Rojo and with git first time

There is a config file where you can change the amount time for a new game

```lua
local config = {}


config.Colors = {
    background = Color3.fromRGB(44,47,51),
    rightColor = Color3.fromRGB(83,141,78),
    almostColor = Color3.fromRGB(181,159,59),
    wrongColor = Color3.fromRGB(58,58,60)
}

return config
```
